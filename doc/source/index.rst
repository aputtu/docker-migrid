Welcome to Docker MiGrid
========================


**Note! This documentation is currently WIP.**

Docker MiGrid provides a prepackaged build of the Minimum Intrusion Grid (MiG) middleware system.
It does this, by building and deploying the MiG across a number of Docker containers, that each is tasked with delievering a single or multiple MiG service(s).

To jump right into having your own version of MiGrid deployed, please
