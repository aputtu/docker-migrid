Background
==========
The MiGrid project started all the way back in 2003 and back then was focused
on providing a complete **grid** compute middleware. It still does that but has
seen more heavy use as a platform for storing, sharing, analyzing and
publishing research data in recent years.
In order to spread the use and contribution the team behind has long ago
open-sourced the whole code base and later provided this docker-migrid project
to ease deployment through a number of containers running the individual
services in a self-contained way and without knowing all the nitty-gritty
details about software dependencies and internal communication.

The core MiGrid developers are still around and can elaborate on the details
and the simple but rather strict design principles going all the way back to
the conception of the project.
